 Game Of Drones 
 (a drone courier system)
 
The main idea is to help imaginable major and his
team in municipality to research possibilities for
creation of a drone delivery network. To plan how
many warehousing facilities to install and their
best location, how many and what kind of drones to
be purchased to deliver given number of orders.
Drones have different characteristics like battery
capacity and consumption, time for recharging, the
weight of the package that can carry and so on.
Having this application, the municipality
representatives can play with it, enter different
input, different places, to position precisely the
warehouses, different numbers of orders, products,
in order to get an understanding of what can be
achieved and plan carefully how to proceed with
this project.
